##SVM_IrisDataset

This study focuses on the classification process performed on the Iris dataset using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm. The main objective is to evaluate the performance of the SVM algorithm and ensure accurate classification of the dataset.
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are effective algorithms used for classification problems. The main goal is to construct a hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space. In this study, a linear kernel was used.

MODEL IMPLEMENTATION

The dataset was trained using the SVM algorithm and evaluated on the test set.

Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used as performance metrics.

MODEL TRAINING AND TESTING

Training Data: 70% of the data was used for training, and 30% for testing.

Model Training: The model was trained using the training dataset.

Prediction and Evaluation: Predictions were made on the test data, and the model’s accuracy was calculated.

DATASET AND PREPROCESSING

Iris Dataset:

    SepalLengthCm: Sepal length (cm)
    
    SepalWidthCm: Sepal width (cm)
    
    PetalLengthCm: Petal length (cm)
    
    PetalWidthCm: Petal width (cm)
    
    Species: Class label (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The dataset consists of ##150 samples, 
each containing the features listed above.

    Data Cleaning and Preparation:
    
    Unnecessary columns were removed.
    
    Missing values were checked and cleaned.
    
    The data was split into training and testing sets.
